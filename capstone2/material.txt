More about me
I am a huge fan of the Tom and Jerry Show (of course the old one; new one sucks!!).
My other interests include, meditation, yoga, making beautiful websites (a recent interest) and watching films.

I am somewhat an introvert, but once we get to know each other, I am pretty sure you would love talking to me!!
